# CalculatorLoggerChallenge

## Overview
This is the challenge project to create a mobile app (using React Native/Android/iOS) which logs calculations as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the app.  I chose to use Swift for the source code and Firebase for backend authentication and services.

## Steps to Build and Run
1. Clone this repository onto your local machine
2. Ensure you have at least XCode 11.7 and an iOS device running iOS 13.7
3. talk about the googeservice-info.plist file
4. possibly have to change bundle id and provisioning profiles / team cert
